I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Missouri-Columbia, under the supervision of [Dr. Praveen Rao](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/home). I am a part of the [Scalable Data Science (SDS) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/sds-lab) at the School of Engineering, where I develop and hack scalable algorithms and systems for data and knowledge management, and information retrieval. I am also affiliated with the [Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI)](https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/center-for-biomedical-informatics), at the School of Medicine, where I explore innovative applications of AI in the various fields of medicine. My main research interests are in the areas of data and knowledge management, data science, and applied machine learning. Prior starting my PhD, I was working as a Technology Assistant at Infosys Technologies, a global leader in software development, consulting for Apple Inc.

Apart from being a true petrolhead, I share a passion with my father of following developments in the heavy duty vehicle industry. All derived from our common passion for driving macho vehicles. while father's interest are on mechanical side I look  at the electronics of it So, If I am not in infront of the terminal, you'll find me in a nearby garage enjoying these modern machinery.
