I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Missouri-Columbia, under the supervision of [Dr. Praveen Rao](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/home). I am a part of the [Scalable Data Science (SDS) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/sds-lab) at the School of Engineering, where I develop scalable algorithms and systems for data and knowledge management, and information retrieval. I am also affiliated with the [Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI)](https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/center-for-biomedical-informatics), at the School of Medicine, where I explore innovative applications of AI in the various fields of medicine. My main research interests are in the areas of data and knowledge management, data science, and applied machine learning.
