I am a Software Engineering Manager with the [TAO Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/tao-toolkit) team at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com). In my current role, I oversee the end-to-end planning and execution of [TAO releases](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tao_pytorch_backend). Leading a team of software developers and deep learning engineers, my focus is on ensuring that the highest standards of reliability, security, transparency, and ethical practices, particularly in the context of Trustworthy AI, are met in the development and deployment of AI technologies.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Missouri-Columbia](https://missouri.edu) in 2022, where I was a part of the [Scalable Data Science (SDS) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/sds-lab) at the MU Collge of Engineering and the [Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI)](https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/center-for-biomedical-informatics) at the MU School of Medicine. During his Ph.D., I was also involved with many interdisciplinary research projects, leveraging his expertise in AI and cluster computing technologies to enable gathering insights and solving challenging problems in the energy and healthcare domains, such as sustainable housing design, genomic analysis, cancer cell detection in histopathology Images, etc. 

In the summer of 2021, I was an Intern at [Arm Inc](https://www.arm.com), automating and optimizing complex 5G system workloads on multicore Arm processors. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Technology Analyst at [Infosys Technologies](https://www.infosys.com), a global leader in software development, consulting for [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com).
