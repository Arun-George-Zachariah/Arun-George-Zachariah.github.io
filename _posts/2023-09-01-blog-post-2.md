summary: XGBoost (which stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular machine learning algorithm that is widely used for building high-performance models. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use XGBoost in a distributed environment to train models faster and more efficiently than ever before. By distributing the workload of training a model across multiple machines, we can process larger datasets and train more complex models in a fraction of the time it would take on a single machine. We will walk you through the process of preparing your data for training and running XGBoost in distributed mode. Whether you are working with large datasets or tackling complex problems, using XGBoost in a distributed environment can help you achieve better results in less time.
