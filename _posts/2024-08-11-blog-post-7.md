summary: In the era of machine learning and artificial intelligence, biases in models have emerged as a significant concern. These biases can lead to unfair treatment of individuals based on race, gender, or other characteristics, which is particularly problematic in applications like facial recognition, hiring algorithms, and criminal justice. Adversarial learning is a promising approach to mitigate these biases while maintaining model performance. This blog will provide an overview of biases in machine learning, demonstrate training a computer vision network, evaluate its biases, and illustrate how adversarial learning can mitigate these biases without compromising performance.
