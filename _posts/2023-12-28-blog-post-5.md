summary: In this exploration of adversarial attacks, we unveil the Carlini & Wagner (C&W) approach, a potent method for crafting imperceptible but deceptive inputs. We introduce the concept of adversarial attacks, emphasizing their impact on the vulnerability of machine learning models. Our journey begins with setting up and training a neural network, paving the way for implementing the C&W attack. The effectiveness of the attack is showcased through visualizations, demonstrating the subtle yet powerful manipulations it imposes on model predictions. The blog concludes by stressing the critical need to comprehend and address adversarial threats in the pursuit of robust and secure AI systems.
