summary: Unveiling the intricacies of adversarial attacks in machine learning, this article explores Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) as a pivotal optimization algorithm. PGD, building on the foundation of gradient descent, excels in crafting robust adversarial examples, offering transferability and stability. Despite computational costs and hyperparameter considerations, PGD stands as a powerful tool for evaluating model vulnerabilities. The article discusses its advantages, such as generating universal perturbations, and its limitations, including sensitivity to hyperparameters. Navigating the delicate balance between accuracy and resilience, understanding PGD emerges as crucial for fortifying machine learning models against evolving adversarial landscapes.
