summary: Dive into the realm of adversarial machine learning with this blog post. Unraveling the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), we explore the vulnerability of neural networks to subtle perturbations. Illustrated by the iconic Panda Experiment from Ian Goodfellow's research, our blog elucidates how FGSM manipulates inputs to mislead models without human detection. The mathematical intricacies behind FGSM are unveiled, showcasing the power and potential risks of adversarial attacks in artificial intelligence. With a concise PyTorch code snippet and an invitation to a Google Colab notebook, readers can witness FGSM in action, perturbing CIFAR-10 dataset inputs to provoke incorrect predictions
