Last month, I graduated with a with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Missouri-Columbia](https://missouri.edu), bringing an end to what has been a challenging, fulfilling, and rewarding journey. This would not have been possible without the endlees support and prayers of many.

First and foremost, I would like to express my most sincere gratitude and deepest appreciation to my advisor and committee chair, [Dr. Praveen Rao](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen), for his guidance, support, motivation, and encouragement. Dr. Rao, you were always there by my side. You could see right through me and know when something was wrong. You always cared for me, and I knew that, I could come to you with any of my problems. I was fortunate to have had you in my life. Thank you for inspiring me and for guiding me. You are an exceptional teacher and, beyond that, an exceptional person. You will always have a special place in my heart.

I would also like to thank my committee members [Dr. Kannappan Palaniappan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kannappan-palaniappan-a860731/), [Dr. Prasad Calyam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-calyam-0b001a1/), and [Dr. Eduardo J Simoes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejsconsulting/) for being a part of my doctoral committee and for their support and guidance.

I would like to acknowledge and thank the National Science Foundation (Grant nos CNS-1747751, CNS-2034247, and IIP-2024429), University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), University of Missouri-Columbia (MU), and TripleBlind for funding my Ph.D.

I am glad to have had the opportunity to work with and be a part of the Big Data Lab at UMKC and the Scalable Data Science Lab at MU. I consider it a privilege to have worked alongside each one of you. My heartfelt thank you to each and every one of you. My fond memories with the lab will last a lifetime.

Ph.D. has been a test of endurance in many aspects, including life outside of research. I would like to take this opportunity to specially thank a few priceless friends I have had, without whom I could have never survived the program. Firstly, to [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-soman/), for his continuous support throughout my Ph.D. journey, giving me a feeling of home, away from home. I would never be able to repay for all that you have done for me. Secondly to [Mohamed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gharibim/), for all the lunch we had together and the advice you gave. They gave me the strength to push further. Thirdly, to [Shivika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivika-prasanna/) for being there for me during some of the darkest times of my life. I will always turn to you for advice. Fourthly, to Kadir. I cannot thank you enough for your presence and the energy you gave me in all forms. Fifthly, to Ahmad for his kind support. And finally, to [Gharib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggharibi/) for the invaluable support and mentorship. I would also like to thank my church family, Rebes, the Bells, the Doddas, and the Arthurs, for their support, prayers, and fellowship.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, my parents, for their love and sacrifice, my grandparents, for their prayers, and my teachers, for molding me and inspiring me. A heartfelt thank you!
