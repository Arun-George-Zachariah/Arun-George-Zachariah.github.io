The various data and privacy regulations introduced around the globe, require data to be stored in a secure and privacy-preserving fashion. Non-compliance with these regulations come with major consequences. This has led to the formation of huge data silos within organizations leading to difficult data analysis along with an increased risk of a data breach. Isolating data also prevents collaborative research. In this presentation we show how we address this through Private-Share, a framework that would enable secure sharing of large scale data.
