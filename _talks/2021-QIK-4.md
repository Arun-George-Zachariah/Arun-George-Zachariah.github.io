In this presentation, we showcase a large-scale image retrieval system for everyday scenes. The system leverages advances in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) for image understanding tasks. The system  allows a user to retrieve highly relevant images by leveraging relationships between the objects within an image. We also demonstrate how the system can let a user to intuitively explore the repository and obtain suggestions for similar image queries to further explore the repository.
